## General Workflow for the uninitiated 
To edit the extension's styling, follow these steps:
* clone the hackathon repository (https://github.com/EEXCESS/hackathon.git)
* enable the developer mode at "chrome://extensions" and choose the option to "load unpacked extension". Navigate to the root folder of the cloned repository
* Edit the desired files (custom css-files reside in the folder /media/css, it also includes a small readme with a description of the files)
* Reload the extension to apply the changes (chrome://extensions -> reload button)
* To push your changes, you need write access to the repository, i.e. you must be a member of the eexcess-repository (if you are not already, send us your github account-name and we will add you)

## What to style
What we would like to be subject to styling
* Overall Appearance (Fonts, Buttons, Icons)
* Layout/Arrangement could be changed for icons and buttons (e.g. privacy settings and user profile settings next to each other?)
* components to consider
  * ResultList
  * Visualization Dashboard
  * FacetScape
  * User Profile Settings and Privacy Settings
