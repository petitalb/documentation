* results (+ weighted query keywords and federated response)
* show/hide extension (+ current url)
* open/close result (+ result url, corresponding query, duration)
* rating (+ resource url, rating value [1|2])
* FacetScape {mode:<"selection" | "deselection" | "include" | "exclude" | "move">,facetName,facetValue,uuid} in separate logfile
